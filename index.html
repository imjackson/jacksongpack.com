                <h1>Hi, I'm Jackson.</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm a front-end developer and undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Computer Science (B.S.) at the University of Delaware. I care about creating fast, simple, and accessible websites.

                    I'm also an advocate for digital privacy rights. I believe that users should have both a complete understanding as well as complete control over how their data is used. Accordingly, this site is completely free of any analytics, trackers, or cookies.
